<h2>Important</h2>

<p>We are currently working on this towards our new version 6 release. These pre-release packages are demonstrating the new system design, protocol and API, and for now, especially, the new resource controller structure and API for reviewing. The code, protocol, and API will be continuously evolving and if you have any suggestion regarding the design or implementation, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/mytestbed/omf/issues">create a new issue</a>.</p>

<p><em>If are looking for the current 5.4 stable release, please go to our official website and follow the <a href="https://omf.mytestbed.net/projects/omf/wiki/Installation">installation guide</a></em></p>

<h2>Introduction to OMF</h2>

<p>OMF is a framework for controlling, instrumenting, and managing experimental platforms (testbeds).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Researchers use OMF to describe, instrument, and execute their experiments.</p></li>
<li><p>Testbed providers use OMF to make their resources discoverable, control access to them, optimise their utilisation through virtualisation, and federation with other testbeds.</p></li>
</ul><p>Please visit our official website <a href="https://www.mytestbed.net">mytestbed.net</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/mytestbed/omf">http://rubydoc.info/github/mytestbed/omf</a></p>

<h2>OMF 6 design documentation</h2>

<p>For full documentation regarding the design of OMF version 6, please visit our <a href="http://omf.mytestbed.net/projects/omf/wiki/Architectural_Foundation">official documentation</a></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>In OMF 6, we switched to the GEM system to release packages.</p>

<p>To install OMF RC, simple do (--pre indicates pre-release):</p>

<pre><code>gem install omf_rc --pre --no-ri --no-rdoc
</code></pre>

<p><em>We are building and testing against Ruby version 1.9.2 and 1.9.3, means we are dropping support for Ruby 1.8.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM (ruby version manageer)</a> is strongly recommended if your OS release doesn't provide these ruby versions.</p>

<p>You could also build and install packages using the latest source from git repository:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/mytestbed/omf.git
</code></pre>

<p>Then inside the repository directory, type:</p>

<pre><code>rake
</code></pre>

<p>This will install all the necessary gems, build omf gems, and run the test files.</p>

<p><em>Some components are linked in omf main repository as git submodules, if you want to use them, simply issue these commands inside the newly cloned repository:</em></p>

<pre><code>git submodule init
git submodule update
</code></pre>

<h2>Extend OMF resource controller system</h2>

<p>One of the biggest changes we are trying to make in version 6 resource controller system is to focus on the core features, and instead of trying to implement all the functionalities and hardware support, we want to provide an abstract entity acts as the proxy, processing the resource related messages based on the <a href="http://omf.mytestbed.net/projects/omf/wiki/ArchitecturalFoundation2ProtocolInteractions">new messaging protocol</a>, and decides what type of the actions to perform according to the operation defined by the message and constrained by the proxy's capabilities which could be easily defined and extended by the resource providers.</p>

<p>In our design, the clients interact with the resource proxies purely via pubsub messages, they publish certain operation (create, request, configure, and release) messages to the pubsub nodes, and subscribe to the nodes for inform messages published by the resource proxies based on the outcome of the these requested operations. The resource proxy instances are actually doing the same, but the opposite, they are subscribing to the pubsub system, react when new operation messages appeared by calling the internal methods corresponding to the content of the operation messages. For example, when a request message contains XML entity property 'speed' received, the resource proxy will try to call method 'request_speed' (it is a naming convention, method name request_property_name is for request messages, and configure_property_name is for configure messages.)</p>

<p>Since the base abstract resource proxy doesn't have request_speed method defined, we need to extend it by implementing a resource proxy definition file, which contains the definition of request_speed functionality. The resource proxy definition is a mixin module, conceptually represents a type of resource it needs to handle. These modules could define a series of functionalities they could support, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Register a module to be used by the resource controller</li>
<li>Properties can be requested</li>
<li>Properties can be configured</li>
<li>Operations should be performed at certain stage, e.g. before resource is ready to use, or before resource is set to be released.</li>
</ul><p>When a new instance of resource proxy is being created, such mixin modules can be used to extend the resource proxy instance. By naming convention, creating an instance of resource proxy with type ':alpha', will result the resource proxy instance extended using mixin resource proxy module 'Alpha'.</p>

<p>This little tutorial will give a brief example on how to implement the resource proxy definitions.</p>

<p>If you would like to extend or improve OMF, simply <a href="https://github.com/mytestbed/omf/fork_select">fork our project</a> via github, and send us pull requests whenever you are ready. There is a great guide <a href="http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/">here</a> regarding forking a repo on github.</p>
